# PickYourPhone - SPA

This SPA is an imitation of an online store, which is focused on the sale of mobile phones. In order to make a purchase, the user must log in to the service, entering the correct data in the contact form. The project was done in a mobile-first approach, using the React library (Create React App environment). The react-router-dom library was used to create routing.
